The game makes use of the <strong>Microsoft Kinect</strong> to allow fun gameplay elements that will enable players to learn a subject without getting bored.</p><p>The game was inspired by <strong>Dance Dance Revolution</strong>, however instead of following dance moves the player must answer a series of questions with each arrow on the dance mat corresponding to an answer. The subject that the game helps to teach is National 4 Mathematics, specifically the subtopics of <strong>Algebra</strong>, <strong>Trigonometry</strong> and <strong>Geometry</strong>.</p>",
